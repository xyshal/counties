Near term
=========
* State percentage counts in the parent tree item (stats generally)
* CSV write (or just work on the "open" CSV file?) -- export otherwise
* What's up with the SVG and </g>
* Some kind of image export.  PNG (or just svg?)
* Packaging on all platforms?  AppImage, NSIS, DMG?

Long term
=========
* Get click mapping working
* Space bar should toggle county visited in the tree view
* Context menu on tree view, incuding "mark all state's counties as visited"?
