Near term
=========
* Write a test for ensuring that all the counties in the resource fill all the
  elements with IDs in the svg
* State percentage counts in the parent tree item (stats generally)
* CSV write (or just work on the "open" CSV file?) -- export otherwise
* Some kind of image export.  PNG (or just svg?)
* Packaging on all platforms?  AppImage, NSIS, DMG?

Long term
